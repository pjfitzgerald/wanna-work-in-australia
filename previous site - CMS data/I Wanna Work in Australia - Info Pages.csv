Some states require that you carry an International Licence with your current foreign licence. Other states request you carry your current foreign driver's licence together with a formal translation of your licence into English.&nbsp;</p><p>In most Australian states and territories (excluding the Northern Territory), you are legally allowed to drive on a current overseas licence. You can only drive vehicles which your overseas licence authorises you to drive and you must drive according to the conditions stipulated on your overseas licence.</p><p>For more information on driving in Australia with an international licence, <a target=""_blank"" data-rt-link-type=""external"" href=""http://www.australia.gov.au/information-and-services/transport-and-regional/driving-with-an-overseas-licence"">click here</a>.</p><p><strong>Buying a car:</strong></p><p>In need of
a car while in Australia? Here are a few pointers on where to go, and what to
look out for!</p><p>&nbsp;If you’re
after a cheap and cheerful vehicle to get you from A to B, we would recommend
jumping on gumtree and having a look around to see what’s on offer. Gumtree is
Australia’s largest listings page, selling anything and everything under the
sun. With over 25,000 cars for sale, we’re confident you’ll find just what you’re
looking for! </p><p><a data-rt-link-type=""external"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.gumtree.com.au/cars"">http://www.gumtree.com.au/cars</a></p><p>&nbsp;If you’re
looking for something a bit more specific, we recommend jumping on
Carsales.com.au. Carsales offers more specific search criteria, meaning you can
narrow down exactly what car would suit you best. Carsales is a website
dedicated to selling cars (would you believe it) so as a result they offer a
bit more: for example you can book an inspection of the car you’re interested
in buying to ensure you’re getting a good price on a safe and reliable vehicle.
The quality of car is better on Carsales, and thus the price is often higher. However,
if you’re in Australia for a year, a reliable car is crucial, and when it comes
time for you to leave this sunny land, you can simply sell your car on the same
website you bought it off!</p><p>&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" data-rt-link-type=""external"" href=""http://www.carsales.com.au/"">http://www.carsales.com.au/</a></p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Tips and tricks:</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>If
possible, bring a friend or work colleague with you to check out the car that
you are interested in buying. Even if English is your mother tongue it can be
hard knowing what you’re getting yourself into when it comes to cars. Having a
friend or colleague with you gives you someone to talk with who isn’t trying to
sell you the car, and can help clear your head, ensuring you make the right decision.</p><p>&nbsp;Do a lot of
research on the car you are wanting to buy! Jump on Google and search for
things like reliability, how many kilometres you can expect to get from a tank
of fuel, what the resale value of the car is (for when you want to sell it
after your time in Australia). You can never do too much research on a car,
especially if it’s second hand!</p><p>&nbsp;We also
recommend you buy a car that already has registration. Although it will seem to
be more expensive, it often works out being a lot cheaper than purchasing an unregistered
vehicle and going through the motions of getting it registered. However, if you
do plan on purchasing a car that does not have registration, it is important to
remember that you CANNOT drive a vehicle on the road if it is <strong>unregistered</strong> or does not hold a current
<strong>roadworthy</strong> <strong>certificate</strong>. Purchasing an unregistered vehicle is not illegal, and
is often a smart move (especially if you’re on a budget!), however there’s a
lot to do before you can drive on Australian roads. For more information on

Meaning for every dollar a you (being a non-resident) earn, you essentially only earn 75 cents. This money is collected by your employer and remitted (set aside) by the Australian Tax Department.&nbsp;</p><h4>Superannuation</h4><p>If you have been earning on average more than $450 per month during your time working in Australia, your employer should have been paying 9.5% additional to your hourly wage rate into an approved Superannuation fund that you have nominated. If you have not nominated your own fund, your employer will have likely selected Hostplus,&nbsp;a fund preferred by the hospitality industry in Australia. Your employer is required to provide you with the details of your nominated superannuation account.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>You can reclaim your super only when you are departing Australia permanently.&nbsp;</strong>In order to reclaim your Superannuation you must have permanently left Australia and your visa must be expired. All foreigners on working visas will most likely have had Superannuation payments deducted from their pay- this is not necessarily the case if you have been paid in cash or contracted as a casual consultant. To claim your super you do not have to have been classed as a resident for tax purposes. Anyone departing Australia has a right to reclaim their super and tax withheld, and it is important to note that claiming your super does not stop your from returning to Australia for work.</p><p>All you need from your employer(s) is your final payment summary. What the summary provides is total hours worked, your rate of pay, and accumulated super/tax withheld. With this information you will be able to claim your return and receive your payment!
