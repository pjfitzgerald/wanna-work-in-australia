derives from head chef and owner Eugenio Maiale’s childhood. As a child Maiale
would play in the backyard of his Adelaide home waiting to hear the chime of “A
Tavola” when dinner was ready.</p><p>On Maiale’s family kitchen table were consistently simple,
honest and traditional style dishes. It was a daily ritual, almost a
meditation, for his Mother to maker her own pasta – from ravioli and tortellini
to tagliolini. She passed her knowledge onto Eugenio who further developed
these techniques during his childhood visits to Italy. He would watch his
relatives make an assortment of pastas, including pappardelle and gnocchi,
rolling the pasta on big wooden tables either by hand or with broom handles.</p><p>Maiale has continued this concept of simple and elegant food
with his first Sydney restaurant. The cuisine can be described as predominantly
“Abruzzese” (a region north-east of the boot, next to Rome), with a heavy
emphasis on dried and fresh pasta cooked to order. His dream was to create a
unique Italian experience. He has done this by creating what has been described
as a “euro chic” dining space which revolves around a 10metre long communal
Indian marble table.</p><h3>Join the A Tavola family.</h3><p>We are always looking for dedicated people to join our
international team at A Tavola. Please note that all applicants must be
eligible to work in Australia. Please write your application and resume in

property from then owner, Ian Bell. Ian was inspired by Cape Lodge in Margaret
River and Yarra Valley’s Chateau Yering Station, when he owned and operated the
small bed &amp; breakfast.</p><p>The manor house and 3 cottages sat amongst the stunning
acreage of young gardens &amp; presented a wonderful opportunity for further
development that would enhance the existing property. Karina and Brian Barry,
were then invited by Coast and Country Properties to manage the existing
B&amp;B and assess its potential.</p><p>Inspired by the beauty and potential of Bells, they had a
vision to develop the B&amp;B into a luxury world-class retreat. To achieve
this goal, they leased the property and worked with Coast and Country to
renovate and develop the property, in a way that would be sympathetic to the
natural beauty of the area and to complement the existing cottages. In 2008,
Stefano Manfredi and Julie Manfredi-Hughes were invited to come on board to
assist with a new restaurant vision and redesign of the entire dining
experience at the property.</p><p>The retreat has become one of the most recognisable and

on from the success of renowned Melbourne restaurants Monsoon, Shakahari and

restaurant in Darwin and Alice Springs. With chefs brought to our shores from

for consistently delighting guests with authentic Asian flavours.</p><h5>THE HANUMAN
STORY</h5><p>Jimmy Shu
grew up in Sri Lanka. The only son of a renowned restaurateur, Jimmy developed a
love of food, of delighting guests and consistently innovating delicious
dishes. Hanuman represents a lifelong commitment to creating exceptional Asian
cuisine.</p><p>The result
of a family passion turned into a career.</p><p>It only
took one trip to Darwin, in search of fresh barramundi for his customers in
Melbourne, to convince Jimmy Shu to sell up his Melbourne based restaurant
empire and move North. His imagination had been captured by the delicious array
of South-East
Asian fruits, herbs and vegetables flourishing in the tropical climate. Since
then Jimm has
championed the development of local Asian market gardens, showcasing them in
his Northern Territory and Cairns restaurants including the now famous Hanuman
restaurant in Darwin which opened in 1992.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",One of Darwin's premiere restaurants with a reputation for consistently delighting guests with authentic Asian Flavours. ,https://daks2k3a4ib2z.cloudfront.net/57d54175dfef76b4387d90d2/58c62ae1c2dc5b4d6cff0ffe_Screen%20Shot%202017-03-13%20at%204.12.00%20pm.png,Mitchell Street, Darwin NT,Northern Territory,darwin,http://www.hanuman.com.au/,-12.462211,130.838868,info@hunuman.com.au,info@hunuman.com.au,https://daks2k3a4ib2z.cloudfront.net/57d54175dfef76b4387d90d2/58be2516b58f6e606c2e494d_TheStables_01.jpg
